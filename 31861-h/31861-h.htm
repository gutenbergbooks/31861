<h2>PRELUDE.</h2>
</div>
<p>Mr. Wayne, glancing out of the window, saw
some one passing down the front steps. Suddenly
a look of recognition came into his face, and he
turned to his wife with the exclamation, &#8220;I declare,
Mary, our daughter Helen is almost a woman,
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Mrs. Wayne, coming to his side
and watching the slender figure going down the
street. Her face bore a look of motherly pride,
but she sighed, as she said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Time and Death are equally inexorable;
they both take our babies from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not after the same fashion,&#8221; replied Mr.
Wayne. &#8220;Death takes them from our sight, where
we cannot witness their growth and development,
cannot know into what beauty they have blossomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Mrs. Wayne, &#8220;we do not recognize
the changes Time makes until they are accomplished.
So gradually does the blossom unfold
that there is no day to which we can point as the
day on which the bud became the full blown flower.
On what day did Helen cease to be a baby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
and become a child? On what day will she cease
to be a child and become a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will know when the actual physical change
takes place, but even after that I trust there will
remain to us something of our little girl. I do
not like to think of her approaching the sentimental
age. How old is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we need have no present fear of a sudden
development of sentimentality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, no,&#8221; replied Mrs. Wayne, &#8220;though
many a mother of girls no older than Helen is
troubled with the question of beaux. Helen, however,
has had the good fortune to have for friends
boys who seemed to enjoy her comradeship, and
I have been very careful not to suggest that their
relation could possibly border on the sentimental.
So far, she has been perfectly obedient and ever
ready to adopt my ideas on all subjects. We have
been such close friends that I believe I am acquainted
with her inmost thoughts, and if she had
felt any romantic emotions I believe she would
have confessed them to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy mother!&#8221; said Mr. Wayne approvingly,
&#8220;I wish all girls found in their mothers their
closest friends and confidants. By the way, you
have always talked freely to her about life&#8217;s mysteries;
have you explained her approaching womanhood
to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Perhaps I have
been a little unwilling to believe that she is really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
nearing that crisis. I cannot bear to lose my little
girl,&#8221; and Mrs. Wayne looked into her husband&#8217;s
face, smiling through her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can understand that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and yet
we believe that only through the normal development
of her physical nature can she be the &#8216;woman
perfected.&#8217; I beg of you not to postpone
your instruction too long. I am more and more
convinced that right knowledge not only safeguards
purity, but really produces true modesty.
To give a young person a reverent knowledge of
self is to insure that delicacy of thought which
preserves the bloom of modesty. If the girls who
are engaged in street flirtations could only be
taught the lesson of true womanhood, I am sure
they would become quiet and lady-like in conduct.
I would rather lose my little girl altogether than
have her fall into this error. You have no hesitancy
about speaking to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least. But I have thought that perhaps
she would indicate by some question that her
mind was becoming ready for the disclosure. It
always seems to me that to force information before
the mind is ready to receive it, is to jeopardize
its reception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait, Mary. You risk too much by allowing
some one else the opportunity to give her
the knowledge with the taint of evil suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&mdash;and I could not bear that anyone
else should explain to her all these mysteries.
I have always been her teacher and I will not relinquish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
that privilege. I will seize the very first
that will allow us uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you not think that you as a father
should have some part in this blessed work of
guiding our daughter? I believe that it will be
most helpful to her to get the man&#8217;s view on the
problems of her life. You know, one never gets
a true perspective of material objects with only
one eye; and I believe this is equally true of life.
I can give her the woman&#8217;s view, but she needs
to know also how men look upon life. She will
be better able to judge of the right or wrong of
conduct if she knows that my view is supported
by your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, as usual,&#8221; replied Mr. Wayne
smiling, &#8220;and you may rest assured that I will always
be glad to supplement your counsel by my
own.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mother.&#8221; The clear girlish voice rang
through the house with persistent intensity
but awakened no responsive
call. Mr. Wayne, coming up the steps,
heard the repeated summons for &#8220;Mother&#8221; and
sent out his answering cry, &#8220;Father&#8217;s here.&#8221;
Quick, light steps answered his call and an urgent
young voice demanded, &#8220;Where&#8217;s mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother has been called away for tonight, so
you&#8217;ll have to put up with father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, dear!&#8221; sighed the girl despondently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is father such a poor substitute, then?&#8221; inquired
Mr. Wayne in an aggrieved tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no,&#8221; responded Helen, quickly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
usually as good as mother; but there were some
special things I wanted to ask her about this evening.
I suppose I can wait,&#8221; she added, dolorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me and see if I won&#8217;t answer tolerably
well. What are these weighty problems?&#8221; drawing
his daughter to his knee as he spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; pouted Helen. &#8220;You always make
fun,&mdash;mother doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, daughter, I had no intention of
making fun. I only wanted you to feel at home
with me. It was a clumsy attempt, I&#8217;ll admit, but
really and truly I would like to be in your confidence&mdash;to
feel that you trust me, too. I can&#8217;t
fill mother&#8217;s place, I know, but I can do what
mother can&#8217;t, I can give you the man&#8217;s view of
things, and that is sometimes of great value for
a girl to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helen, snuggling down in her father&#8217;s
lap, for they were great friends and she felt
his sympathy. &#8220;I often wish we could know how
things look to other people. I know boys don&#8217;t
look at matters as girls do, but we can&#8217;t always tell
just what they do think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; replied Mr. Wayne, gravely.
&#8220;I often think that if girls knew just what boys
say among themselves it would make them more
careful of their conduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, not long ago I was on a steamer
where there was dancing. I went into the smoking
room, and there I heard the comments of the
young men. I am sure the girls had no idea how
their dress, figures, freedom and flirtatiousness
were criticised and laughed at by these young
men, who seemed to them, doubtless, so very nice
and polite. Of course, these girls were mostly
strangers to the young men and were getting acquainted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
without introductions, probably thinking
it fine fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father. I&#8217;ve heard some of the real nice
girls talk about getting acquainted in that way,
and they seem to think it all right. Someway, it
never seemed quite nice to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not, my daughter. I should be sorry to
have you form acquaintances in that way. You
never can tell what a man&#8217;s character is by his
clothes or manners. Indeed, you may think you
know a man pretty well, and yet be mistaken. I
suppose girls who are familiar with young men
and allow them liberties imagine that they are
trustworthy. I sat in front of two young men on
a train not long ago. They appeared well and
really were nice, as boys go, but they had the
usual boy&#8217;s idea as to honor. They were talking
freely of the girls they knew, discussing their
merits and charms, saying that this one was soft
and &#8216;huggable,&#8217; that another was sweet to kiss&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, father!&#8221; exclaimed Helen, in a fury of surprise
and anger. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t talk that way so
that you could hear! And call the girls by name,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they did, dear. Then after they had discussed
several, who all seemed to allow great
freedom, they mentioned another name, and their
whole manner changed. &#8216;Ah,&#8217; said one, &#8216;there&#8217;s
no nonsense about her. It&#8217;s &#8216;hands off&#8217; there
every time and&#8217;&mdash;he went on, with great emphasis,
&#8216;that&#8217;s the kind of a girl I mean to marry. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
man doesn&#8217;t want to feel that his wife&#8217;s been slobbered
over by all the young men of her acquaintance.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen hid her face on her father&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;How perfectly dreadful!&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were
not gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that,&mdash;and yet the conduct of the
girls in permitting such freedom was really an
excuse for their speaking so discourteously of
them. The girls had not maintained their own
self-respect, and therefore had not secured the
respect of the young men. The girl who respected
herself compelled respect from them, and that
is the idea I wish to impress on your mind. Never
expect any one to respect you more than you
respect yourself, nor to shield your honor if you
have placed yourself in their power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; said Helen hesitatingly, &#8220;most of
the girls and boys think it no harm to kiss each
other good night, and the girls say the boys would
be offended if a girl refused.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are mistaken. Of course, the boys like
to have the girls think so; but they don&#8217;t talk that
way among themselves, you may be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see, father,&#8221; urged Helen, hesitatingly,
&#8220;they say they are engaged, and that makes
it all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do they stay engaged?&#8221; asked Mr.
Wayne. &#8220;Do they really consider it a true engagement,
to end ultimately in marriage, or is it
merely an excuse for freedom of association?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;O, they&#8217;re all the time breaking their engagements.
I don&#8217;t believe they expect them to last
very long. Now, there&#8217;s Dora Ills. She&#8217;s only
sixteen and she says she&#8217;s been engaged four
times, and when she breaks the engagement she
doesn&#8217;t give back the ring. She&#8217;s making a collection
of engagement rings, she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very evident that she cannot have the
highest respect for herself. I knew of a girl
whose sister had been engaged several times and
who said to her, &#8216;Why, Lida, you&#8217;ve never been
engaged yet, have you?&#8217; And Lida replied, &#8216;No,
and I have made up my mind that I&#8217;ll not be one
of your pawed-over girls.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her expression was not an elegant one, but it
showed that she respected herself, and of course,
she will be more truly respected by the young
men if she does not permit them to approach too
closely. A girl is very much mistaken if she fancies
that a young man thinks more of her if she
lets him be familiar. On the other hand, it is
always true that he thinks more of her if she
makes him feel that she is not to be carelessly
approached. As one boy said to me, &#8216;Girls ought
to know that boys always want most that which
is hardest to get.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father, if it&#8217;s so difficult for boys and
girls to be together and act as they should,
wouldn&#8217;t it be best to keep them entirely apart
until they are old enough to marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what they think in the old world, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
girls are kept shut up in schools and convents until
they are grown; then their parents select a
husband for them, and after they are married they
are allowed to go into society. I am afraid our
girls wouldn&#8217;t like that,&mdash;they&#8217;d want to select
their own husbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could do that after they got out of
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My observation is that the girl who has been
shut up away from young men, is the very one
who doesn&#8217;t know how to act when she comes out
of school. She has very romantic ideas, and is
quite apt to be misled by a glittering exterior.
She is less able to judge wisely or to guide her
own conduct judiciously than the girl who, having
been educated with boys, has less romantic ideas
concerning them. No, I believe in co-education
and in the common social life for both sexes; but
with it I should ask that all young people should
be taught to respect themselves and each other,
and to understand their responsibility to future
generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is that responsibility? What have
we young people to do with future generations?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just exactly what we older people once had.
We didn&#8217;t think of it in our youth, but we can
see now that even then we were creating our own
characters and at the same time the characters of
our future children. Now, I can see in you many
of my own youthful characteristics. I can understand
why you find it hard to do things that I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
like you to do, and easy to do some I&#8217;d rather you
wouldn&#8217;t do. And if, in the years to come, you
have a daughter, she will be apt to be largely
what you are now. All the efforts you make now
to overcome your own faults are in reality helping
to overcome those faults for her also. Suppose
the young people knew and thought of these
things; don&#8217;t you think they would judge more
wisely of what they ought to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I know what I&#8217;d want my daughter
to do, it seems to me, even better than I could tell
what I ought to do myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be a good way to decide your
own conduct&mdash;to do only those things which you&#8217;d
be perfectly willing your daughter should do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father, tell me why it&#8217;s so much more
important for girls to be particular about what
they do than for boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, people seem to think it is. The other
day Johnnie Webster was going to a show and his
little sister Carrie wanted to go, too, and he told
her it was no place for girls, and she said, &#8216;Then
it is no place for boys&#8217;; and he said, &#8216;But boys
don&#8217;t have to be as good as girls.&#8217; And his father
and mother both heard it and never said a word.
They only laughed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unfortunately quite a common idea that
boys and men do not have to be as good as girls
and women; but it is not God&#8217;s idea. He doesn&#8217;t
have two standards of morals, and I think the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
time is coming when men will be glad to live up
to the highest level of purity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it seems worse for girls to
swear or drink or gamble than for boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does <i>seem</i> worse, because we have had such
high ideals for women; but to God it must seem
no worse, because he judges of us as <i>souls</i>, not
as men and women, and He has laid down only
one rule of conduct for all souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know how the idea ever grew that
it was not so bad for men to do wrong as for
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we cannot now see all the reasons for
this state of things, but we can see at least one
reason. Many, many years ago men bought their
wives, or took them by force from others, so they
felt that they <i>owned</i> their wives. Of course, each
man liked to feel that his wife was above reproach,
that she really did belong to him; therefore,
he held any lack of fidelity as a great sin
against himself. But he did not think that he
belonged to her. She had neither bought nor captured
him, so she had no power over him, except
such as she could gain by her fascinations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, he didn&#8217;t care to be bound by the
same rigid ideas to which he held her. He felt
himself free to do what fancy dictated. The
general level of morals was low, so he followed
the pleasures of sense, and the wife could only
submit, or try to be more fascinating to him than
any one else. But if he was great and influential
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
or handsome, and was not bound by any moral
restraints, there would be other women desirous
of gaining his attentions and the material comforts
he might be able to give, and he would quite
willingly think himself free to follow his fancy
without censure. In this way has grown up the
double moral standard, the pure woman holding
herself to the strictest morality, and men imagining
themselves not so sternly held to the narrow
path of absolute purity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women are not now slaves, bought as wives
and valued for their personal charms alone. They
have intellectual power and moral force and social
influence, and they can, if they will, create the
single moral standard,&mdash;that is, the one high ideal
for both men and women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, father, do you think girls have as much
power as that? It always seems to me as if girls
might be of value when they are grown up, but
that while we are girls we can&#8217;t do much to make
the world better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the mistake girls generally make, when
in fact the most important time of life is youth.
It is while you are girls that you are forming your
own character, and at the same time you are helping
to form the character of the generations to
come. You are of far more value to the nation
now, while you are young and can make of yourselves
almost anything you please, than you will
be when you are old and your habits are fixed.
If girls all lived nobly and exacted noble conduct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
of all their associates, boys as well as girls, it
would not take long to settle all questions of reform.
Young men will be what young women
ask them to be, and that, you see, makes girls of
great importance. Do you remember what we
were reading in Sesame and Lilies the other day
about woman&#8217;s queenly power? Get the book
and let us read it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen brought the book, and, finding the place,
read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s power is for rule, not for battle, and
her intellect is not for invention or creation, but
for sweet ordering, arrangement and decision.
Her great function is Praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not a war in the world, no, nor an
injustice, but you women are answerable for it,
not in that you have provoked, but in that you
have not hindered. Men, by their nature, are
prone to fight. They will fight for any cause or
none. It is for you to choose their cause for
them, and to forbid when there is no cause. There
is no suffering, no injustice, no misery in the
earth, but the guilt of it lies with you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queens you must always be: queens to your
lovers: queens to your husbands and sons: queens
of higher mystery to the world beyond, which
bows itself and will forever bow before the myrtle
crown and the stainless sceptre of womanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen leaned her head on her father&#8217;s shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
in silence. Then she said, softly: &#8220;It makes me
almost afraid to become a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wayne kissed his daughter tenderly, saying:
&#8220;It is worthy your highest ambition to be a
noble woman. I would be glad to see you such
an one as is pictured in Lowell&#8217;s poem of Irene.
Would you like to read it to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen took the book from her father&#8217;s hand
and read.</p>
<h3>IRENE.</h3>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Hers is a spirit deep, and crystal-clear;</p>
<p>Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies,</p>
<p>Free without boldness, meek without a fear,</p>
<p>Quicker to look than speak its sympathies;</p>
<p>Far down into her large and patient eyes</p>
<p>I gaze, deep-drinking of the infinite,</p>
<p>As, in the mid-watch of a clear, still night,</p>
<p>I look into the fathomless blue skies.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So circled lives she with Love&#8217;s holy light,</p>
<p>That from the shade of self she walketh free:</p>
<p>The garden of her soul still keepeth she</p>
<p>An Eden where the snake did never enter;</p>
<p>She hath a natural, wise sincerity,</p>
<p>A simple truthfulness, and these have lent her</p>
<p>A dignity as moveless as the center:</p>
<p>So that no influence of earth can stir</p>
<p>Her steadfast courage, nor can take away</p>
<p>The holy peacefulness, which, night and day,</p>
<p>Unto her queenly soul doth minister.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Most gentle is she; her large charity</p>
<p>(An all unwitting, childlike gift to her)</p>
<p>Not freer is to give than meek to bear;</p>
<p>And, though herself not unacquaint with care,</p>
<p>Hath in her heart wide room for all that be&mdash;</p>
<p>Her heart that hath no secrets of its own,</p>
<p>But open as an eglantine full blown.</p>
<p>Cloudless forever is her brow serene,</p>
<p>Speaking calm hope and trust within her, whence</p>
<p>Welleth a noiseless spring of patience,</p>
<p>That keepeth all her life so fresh, so green</p>
<p>And full of holiness, that every look,</p>
<p>The greatness of her woman&#8217;s soul revealing,</p>
<p>Unto me bringeth blessing, and a feeling</p>
<p>As when I read in God&#8217;s own holy book.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>A graciousness in giving that doth make</p>
<p>The small gift greatest, and a sense most meek</p>
<p>Of worthiness, that doth not fear to take</p>
<p>From others, but which always fears to speak</p>
<p>Its thanks in utterance, for the giver&#8217;s sake;</p>
<p>The deep religion of a thankful heart,</p>
<p>Which rests instinctively in heaven&#8217;s clear law</p>
<p>With a full peace, that never can depart</p>
<p>From its own steadfastness;&mdash;a holy awe</p>
<p>For holy things,&mdash;not those which men call holy,</p>
<p>But such as are revealed to the eyes</p>
<p>Of a true woman&#8217;s soul bent down and lowly</p>
<p>Before the face of daily mysteries:</p>
<p>A love that blossoms soon, but ripens slowly</p>
<p>To the full goldenness of fruitful prime,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>Enduring with a firmness that defies</p>
<p>All shallow tricks of circumstance and time,</p>
<p>By a sure insight knowing where to cling,</p>
<p>And where it clingeth never withering:</p>
<p>These are Irene&#8217;s dowry, which no fate</p>
<p>Can shake from their serene, deep-builded state.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>In-seeing sympathy is hers, which chasteneth</p>
<p>No less than loveth, scorning to be bound</p>
<p>With fear of blame, and yet which ever hasteneth</p>
<p>To pour the balm of kind looks on the wound,</p>
<p>If they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes,</p>
<p>Giving itself a pang for others&#8217; sakes:</p>
<p>No want of faith, that chills with sidelong eye,</p>
<p>Hath she; no <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title='Was jeaousy'>jealousy</ins>, no Levite pride</p>
<p>That passeth by upon the other side:</p>
<p>For in her soul there never dwelt a lie.</p>
<p>Right from the hand of God her spirit came</p>
<p>Unstained, and she hath ne&#8217;er forgotten whence</p>
<p>It came, nor wandered far from thence,</p>
<p>But labored to keep her still the same,</p>
<p>Near to her place of birth, that she may not</p>
<p>Soil her white raiment with an earthly spot.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Yet sets she not her soul so steadily</p>
<p>Above, that she forgets her ties to earth,</p>
<p>But her whole thought would almost seem to be</p>
<p>How to make glad one lowly human hearth;</p>
<p>And to make earth next heaven; and her heart</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Herein doth show its most exceeding worth,</p>
<p>That, bearing in our frailty her just part,</p>
<p>She hath not shrunk from evils of this life,</p>
<p>But hath gone calmly forth into the strife,</p>
<p>And all its sin and sorrows hath withstood</p>
<p>With lofty strength of patient womanhood:</p>
<p>For this I love her great soul more than all,</p>
<p>That, being bound, like us, with earthy thrall,</p>
<p>For with a gentle courage she doth strive</p>
<p>In thought and word and feeling so to live.</p>
<p>She walks so bright and heaven-like therein,&mdash;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Too wise, too meek, too womanly, to sin.</p>
<p>Like a lone star through riven storm-clouds seen</p>
<p>By sailors, tempest-tost upon the sea,</p>
<p>Telling of rest and peaceful havens nigh,</p>
<p>Unto my soul her star-like soul hath been,</p>
<p>Her sight as full of hope and calm to me;</p>
<p>For she unto herself hath builded high</p>
<p>A home serene, wherein to lay her head,</p>
<p>Earth&#8217;s noblest thing, a Woman perfected.</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;That is a beautiful picture of what a girl may
be, and I&#8217;d be glad to see you making it your
model.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helen, slowly. Then, with more enthusiasm,
&#8220;You know, father, I&#8217;ve always wished
I were a boy. It seems so much grander to be
a man than a woman. A man&#8217;s life is so much
freer, and he can do so much greater things, you
know. Of course, I shall try to be a good woman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
but I wish women could do big things, the way
men can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What wondrous things can men do that
women can&#8217;t do?&#8221; asked Mr. Wayne with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Helen, clasping her hands with
enthusiasm, &#8220;just see what men do. They build
immense houses, and great bridges&mdash;Oh, they
make the world, and women just sit in the house
and look on. I&#8217;d like to <i>do</i> something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wayne smoothed back the hair from the
forehead of his enthusiastic daughter with a tender
smile, as he replied, &#8220;It does seem on the
surface as if men did greater things than women,
but it is only seeming, my dear. It is just as
grand a thing to be a woman as to be a man.
True, woman&#8217;s work does not show on the surface
so plainly, but she works with more enduring
material than does man in creating the world of
things. We can see the great works of man&#8217;s
hands and they impress us with a sense of his
power; but it is <i>mind</i> that does the real work, and
women have <i>minds</i>, or <i>are</i> minds, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but they must devote their minds
to cooking and dishwashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen women doing other things. In
the old world I saw women digging ditches, carrying
brick and mortar to the top of high buildings,
ploughing in the fields; in fact, working just like
men. The great buildings of the World&#8217;s Exposition
erected in Vienna in 1873, were largely the
work of women&#8217;s hands. You are not anxious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
to exchange dishwashing for such work, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no, indeed; but it is man who plans such
work and superintends its doing. A woman could
not have planned Brooklyn bridge, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite true that a woman did not plan it,
but did you know that it was completed under a
woman&#8217;s supervision?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, was it? How did that happen? Tell me
all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened this way. Mr. Roebling, who was
superintending its construction, was taken ill, and
his wife took his place and personally gave oversight
to every part of the work until it was done.
You see, her being a woman did not prevent her
doing the work. But if she had been only a careless
or an ignorant woman she could not have
done it. It was <i>mind</i>, you see, and cultured
mind at that, which was the master
power. If she had not been working with
him in making the plans, she could not have
worked for him in carrying them out. Instead
of lamenting over your sex, you would
better rejoice in the fact that you are a <i>spirit</i>, and
realize that your power in all spheres of activity
will be measured by the cultivation of your mental
and spiritual powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father, even if I do cultivate my mind, I
shall probably never have an opportunity to do
such a grand thing as help to build a Brooklyn
bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not, but you can do a greater thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
You can fit yourself to work on finer material than
insensate stones. You can mould plastic minds.
It is a far greater thing to wield spiritual forces
than to manipulate inorganic matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, all men do not merely make <i>things</i>. There
are great statesmen, great soldiers, great writers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, but you would not want to be a soldier,
I am sure. To kill is not a glorious profession.
And to be a great statesman or writer is not
merely a question of sex; it is a question of
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think women have as much ability as
men? Aren&#8217;t men really smarter than women?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wayne smiled at the girl&#8217;s eagerness. &#8220;I
do not compare men and women to decide their
relative ability,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I believe their
minds differ, but that does not imply that one is
superior and the other inferior. Each is superior
in its own place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But men&#8217;s minds are so much stronger, father.
Women never can be on the same level as men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me two needles of different sizes from
your work basket. Now, tell me, which is superior
to the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends on what you want to do with
them,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;If you were going to sew
on shoe buttons, you&#8217;d use this big one. If you
wanted to hem a cambric handkerchief, you&#8217;d take
this fine one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. Each is superior in its special place,
and both are necessary. This is just as it seems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to me in regard to the ability of men and women.
They are both minds; one strong, robust, enduring
rough usage; the other fine, delicate, going where
the first cannot go, and therefore supplementing
it, and increasing the range of work that can be
accomplished. The fine needle might complain
that it could not do hard work, but do you think
the complaint would be justifiable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, I don&#8217;t; but tell me what great things
a woman can do&mdash;things that are worth while, I
mean; something besides keep house and take
care of children. It seems to me that merely to
be a cook and nurse girl is not a very high calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might be a chemist,&#8221; suggested Mr.
Wayne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, a few women might; but I mean something
that I could be, or other girls like me who
have no special talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a great need of scientific knowledge
among women. Every housekeeper needs to
know something of chemistry. The woman who
knows the chemical action of acids and alkalies
on each other will never use soda with sweet milk,
nor make the mistake of using an excess of soda
with sour milk. And every day, in a myriad of
ways, her knowledge of chemistry will be called
into use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then every woman should be a psychologist,
most especially if she is to have the care of children.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;O, father, you use such big words. Tell me
just what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that the office of nurse or mother demands
the highest study of mental evolution.
More big words, but I&#8217;ll try to make you understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to you that any one can take care of
a baby. But what is a baby? Not just a helpless
little animal, to be fed and clothed and kept
warm. A baby is a spirit in the process of development.
From the moment of birth it is being
educated by everything around it; the very tones
of voice used in speaking to it are educating it.
It is a great thing to be President of the United
States, but that president was once a baby. His
life depended on the way he was fed and cared
for; his character was largely created by the circumstances
of his life; and his mental powers&mdash;which
he inherited from both parents&mdash;were in
his babyhood and early childhood largely under
the training of some woman. That woman, whether
mother or nurse, had the first chance to develop
him, to make him worthy or unworthy. John
Quincy Adams said, &#8216;All I am I owe to my mother,&#8217;
and that is the testimony of many of earth&#8217;s
greatest men. Garfield&#8217;s first kiss after his inauguration
was very justly given to his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;God has entrusted mothers with life&#8217;s grandest
work, the moulding of humanity in its plastic
stage. You have done clay modelling in school,
and you know that when the clay is fresh and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
moist you can make of it almost anything you
will, but when it has hardened it is past remodelling.
It is just the same with humanity. In
babyhood the mind is plastic; when one has grown
to maturity, it is hard and unyielding. Man makes
<i>things</i>; woman makes <i>men</i>. Which is the greater
work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen hesitated. &#8220;It seems very noble as you
talk of it, to train a child; but you know people
don&#8217;t feel that way. Mothers cuddle their babies,
to be sure, but men think caring for babies is beneath
them. They sneer at it as woman&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all men, dear. Some of the great men of
the world have spent years in the study of infancy,
realizing that to know how the baby develops will
enable them to understand better how to train it,
and rightly to train babies is in reality to make
the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen, leaning her head back on her father&#8217;s
shoulder, was silent for a while, then she kissed
him softly, saying, &#8220;Thank you, father dear. It
has been a beautiful talk together. I am sure it
will help me to be a better woman.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, daughter,&#8221; said Mr. Wayne, as
Helen and he were sitting by the fire
one Sabbath afternoon while Mrs.
Wayne had gone to her room to rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&mdash;&#8221; said Helen hesitatingly, &#8220;there is
something I have been thinking about, but I&#8217;m
afraid you&#8217;ll think it silly to ask you about it.
You&#8217;ll think I ought to be able to decide it for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing that is of enough importance to be a
problem to my daughter is silly to me. State your
difficulty, and we&#8217;ll see if we cannot clear it
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, father, I&#8217;d like to know what you think
about boys and girls writing to each other. Of
course, I don&#8217;t mean the foolish notes they send
back and forth in school. I know that is silly,
but I mean correspond. You see, Paul Winslow
and Robert Bates are going to move away and
they&#8217;re asking the girls to correspond with them,
and the girls all say it will be great fun; but I
don&#8217;t know. You know, mother has taught me
that things that seem funny at one time don&#8217;t
seem so at another, and I&#8217;ve been wondering if
this is one of those things. When Robert asked
me if I&#8217;d write to him I said I&#8217;d ask mother, and
he seemed to get mad. He said if it was such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
dangerous thing to correspond with him that I
had to ask my mother, he guessed I&#8217;d better not
write to him. I said I asked my mother about
everything. And he said &#8216;I suppose you show her
your letters,&#8217; and I said &#8216;Of course,&#8217; and then he
said he&#8217;d excuse me from writing to him. The
girls all said I was very foolish; that it was perfectly
right to correspond with boys you knew,
and that our mothers wouldn&#8217;t want to be bothered
to read all the letters we received. But I
know mother doesn&#8217;t think it a bother, and I
wouldn&#8217;t enjoy my letters if I didn&#8217;t share them
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly much safer to keep in confidence
with your mother,&#8221; said Mr. Wayne, &#8220;and
I should say that a young man who didn&#8217;t want
you to show his letters to your mother is one you
wouldn&#8217;t want to correspond with. I should be
afraid that he&#8217;d be one who would show your letters
to his boy friends and perhaps make fun of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, father! Do you think that? It seems to
me that wouldn&#8217;t be honorable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys do not always have the highest ideals of
honor, my dear. I remember once, when I was
young, I was camping with a lot of young fellows.
I think all of them were corresponding
with girls, and these letters were common property.
They were read aloud as we gathered
around the camp fire in the evening; their bad
spelling was laughed at and their silly sentimentalities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
talked of in ways that I am sure would
have made the girls&#8217; cheeks burn with shame.
They thought, of course, that the boy they wrote to
would keep their letters as sweet secrets. I
learned a good deal that summer about girls whom
I had never seen. Some of them I came to know
afterwards, and I often wondered what they would
say if I should quote from their letters some foolish
sentimentality which they imagined no one
knew about except the one to whom it was written.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, father, you&#8217;d say we ought never to correspond
with boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t quite say that. I can see that a
friendly correspondence might be helpful. It
seems to me that girls and boys can be a great
help and inspiration to each other. I once had a
girl correspondent who wrote most charming letters,
simple recitals of her daily life with some of
her little moralizings thrown in. Perhaps I
would smile at them now, but they surely helped
me to have higher ideals and made me have a
great reverence for womanhood. There was one
thing about her letters that I thought strange
then, but I now think it very wise. She always
signed every letter with her full name, never with
her home pet name. I have often thought of it,
and I believe it is a good plan. Certainly, if you
knew that you would sign your full name to every
letter, you would not be as apt to write foolishly
as if your identity would be hidden under some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
nickname. And you never know what will become
of your letters. A few days ago I read in
the newspaper some foolish letters written by a
girl to a man. She never imagined that any one
else would read them. Yet here they were, in
print, and the whole country was commenting on
them. They were all signed by some soubriquet
such as &#8216;Your darlingest Babe,&#8217; or &#8216;Little Jimmy,&#8217;
and under the shield of such a signature she no
doubt felt safe. But a dark tragedy tore away the
flimsy protection and every one saw all her
foolishness and sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen shuddered. &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll make it a
rule,&#8221; she said, soberly, &#8220;to write only such things
in my letters that I&#8217;d be willing to have printed
over my own name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good resolution, and I hope you&#8217;ll
keep it. You can feel quite certain that if you
don&#8217;t want to sign your own name to your letter
you&#8217;d better not write it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of suggestions I would
like to make to you along the line of your association
with young men,&#8221; said Mr. Wayne, after
a pause. &#8220;You have had no experience as yet,
but in a few years you will be a woman and maybe
then you&#8217;ll have no father or mother to give
you counsel. As you know, I don&#8217;t want to shut
you away from the society of young men, but
I want you to know how to make it of the greatest
advantage to you and to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, dear, that women and girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
always make the moral standards which maintain
in the society of which they form a part?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen shook her head doubtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see how that can be,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for everybody
says that women are better than men; and I am
sure boys do lots of things that we girls would
never think of doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; replied Mr. Wayne, &#8220;but that is
because the men and boys set higher standards
for the women and girls than they in turn set
for the men and boys. No boy would be seen
in the street with a girl who was smoking a
cigar; yet girls, good girls too, let boys smoke
in their company. No matter how immoral a
man may be, he always demands that the women
who belong to him, his wife, mother, sister or
sweetheart, shall be pure and above reproach.
He will even claim that a wife&#8217;s misconduct sullies
his honor; but she never claims that his
immorality is her responsibility. She will even
marry a man whom she knows to be dissipated,
foolishly trusting that her love will reform him.
A broken heart and degenerate children too often
prove how seriously she has failed. Yes, dear,
I am right in saying that women are to blame that
men do not have higher ideals and live up to
them. Ruskin says, &#8216;The soul&#8217;s armor is never
well set to a heart unless a woman&#8217;s hand has
braced it; and it is only when she braces it loosely
that the honor of manhood fails.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s putting a great responsibility on women,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; sighed Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, daughter, but no greater than is placed
on man. Each sex should be the protector and
inspirer of the other. But instead of that, they
often tempt and mislead each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good girls don&#8217;t tempt boys, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that they do, dear. They may not
be aware of what they are doing, but nevertheless
they may be sources of temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t see how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not, but I can tell you, for I remember
my own youth and know how girls may
tempt boys unwittingly. When in college I was
a boarder in a family where there were several
other students, and two or three pretty High
School girls. One of them was very coquettish,
and was always &#8216;making goo-goo eyes,&#8217; at the
boys, as they say now-a-days. She couldn&#8217;t talk
in a straightforward manner, but always with sidewise
glances from downcast lids that seemed invitations
to a nearer approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the students was one who was very
retiring and bashful. He rarely spoke to the girls
and seemed quite embarrassed if they spoke to
him. This girl seemed to set herself to
work to flirt with him. She would glance up
at him so appealingly that we boys couldn&#8217;t
help guying him about it. One evening when
she was plying her arts&mdash;not with evil intent,
but she loved to flirt and did not understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
what that might mean to a young man&mdash;all
at once he seized her around the waist and
kissed her furiously. She was in a rage in a
moment, and said some pretty sharp things about
his lack of gentlemanliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stood his ground without flinching. &#8216;I&#8217;m
as much of a gentleman as you are a lady,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;I have let you alone, but you have been
tormenting me for weeks. You liked to try how
far you could go, and thought yourself virtuous
because you felt no temptation. You didn&#8217;t care
how you tempted me, or the other boys. You have
tried your powers in public. O, yes, you are
too good to be sly! And so I determined to give
you a public lesson, and everybody here, I am
sure, is thankful to me for it. Now, perhaps, you
will let us alone. We want to be good, we want
to treat all women with respect; yet, when you
pretty pink-and-white creatures smile and smirk
and set us on fire, then you say we are bad, we
are not gentlemen. Maybe not. But we are
men, and we should find in you the true womanhood
which is our salvation.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see him now, as he stood up so proudly,
forgetting his bashfulness in his righteous indignation,&mdash;and
we all applauded him, I am glad to
say. The girl was offended with us all, and left
the house and sought another boarding place.
In her stead came a real, true, womanly girl.
Full of fun, a real comrade, ready to join our
sports, to help us in every way possible, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
always making us feel that we were in honor
bound to protect her from even a flirtatious
thought. Every man in the house was her friend,
some of them, I am sure, her adorers, but none
ever ventured to approach her with familiarity.
If she should meet any of us to-day, she would
not have to blush in the presence of her husband
and children at the memory of any happening
of those days.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kind of a woman I want you to
be, my daughter dear, a woman realizing a
woman&#8217;s true place and power, as Ruskin says,
&#8216;Power to heal, to redeem, to guide, to guard!&#8217;
Just hand me the book and let me read you
a few words from his essay on War. &#8216;Believe
me!&#8217; he says, &#8216;the whole course and character
of your lovers&#8217; lives is in your hand. What you
would have them be they shall be, if you not
only desire but deserve to have them so; for
they are but mirrors in which you will see yourselves
imaged. If you are frivolous, they will
be so also; if you have no understanding of the
scope of their duty, they will also forget it; they
will listen,&mdash;they can listen&mdash;to no other interpretation
of it than that uttered from your lips.
Bid them be brave;&mdash;they will be brave for you;
bid them be cowards, and how noble soever they
be, they will quail for you. Bid them be wise,
and they will be wise for you; mock at their
counsels and they will be fools for you, such,
and so absolute is your rule over them.&#8217; Isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
that a wonderful power that is in woman&#8217;s hands?
And it is true, as he further says, just here:
&#8216;Whatever of the best he can conceive, it is her
part to be; whatever of the highest he can hope,
it is hers to promise; all that is dark in him
she must purge into purity; all that is failing in
him she must strengthen into truth; from her,
through all the world&#8217;s clamour, he must win his
praise; in her, through all the world&#8217;s warfare,
he must find his peace.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen sighed. &#8220;It is so much to ask,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Has nothing been written to the men, how
they must help and protect women?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wayne smiled, as he kissed his little
daughter and said, &#8220;Whatever has been written
for men I will keep to tell my son, and I trust
it will help him to reverence all womanhood.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Mrs. Wayne and her daughter sat at
their window they saw a carriage dash
by containing a handsomely dressed
woman. Shortly after a very pretty
girl passed the house, talking busily with a boy of
her own age.</p>
<p>&#8220;How funny some mothers are,&#8221; said Helen.
&#8220;That was Mrs. Eversman who rode by just now,
and that&#8217;s Corrinne, her daughter. Mrs. Eversman
pays no attention to Corrinne except to buy her
pretty clothes, and scold her for carelessness.
Corrinne goes where she pleases. She has lots
of beaux, and when they call she won&#8217;t let her
mother come into the parlor,&mdash;she says she doesn&#8217;t
want her &#8216;snooping&#8217; around, and Mrs. Eversman
only laughs. She seems to think it smart. And,
mother, Corrinne has such lovely presents from
boys and young men. And when she goes to the
theatre with a young man, she insists on having
a carriage and flowers and a supper afterward.
She says no fellow need come around her unless
he has &#8216;the spondulics,&#8217; she calls money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; said Mrs. Wayne thoughtfully.
&#8220;How little she understands the purpose of life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she says she wants to have a good time,&#8221;
urged Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; was Mrs. Wayne&#8217;s reply. &#8220;Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
girl is entitled to a good time, but that does
not of necessity consist of spending money. I
should think she wouldn&#8217;t like to be under such
obligations to young men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I guess she doesn&#8217;t think she is under obligations.
She thinks they are under obligation
to her for condescending to go with them. But,
mother, ought a girl let a young man spend money
on her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, my dear, when you are old enough
to go out with young men that you will care
too much for yourself to be willing to take expensive
gifts. A certain amount of expenditure is
allowable. A few flowers, a book, or a piece
of music, but never elegant jewelry or articles
of clothing. That is not only bad taste but it is
often a direct incentive for young men of small
salaries to be dishonest. Corrinne, and girls
like her, do not know how much they may be
responsible for young men becoming untrue to
their business trusts, nor how much they might
do to strengthen young men in their purposes to
be honest. You remember Aunt Elsie and Uncle
Harold. He is a man of means now, but he was
once a poor young clerk. He admired Elsie and
wanted to show her every attention, but she knew
his salary would not permit extravagance; so when
he first asked her to go to some public entertainment,
he said he would come with a carriage
at the appointed time. At once she said
decidedly, &#8216;Then I will not go. It is not far.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
If it is a fine night, we can walk. If it rains,
we can go on the street cars. You may send me
a few flowers, but we will not have an opera supper
nor indulge in needless carriages!&#8217; Of course
he objected, and urged that he could afford it.
&#8216;But I can&#8217;t,&#8217; was her reply. And years after, when
they were married, he confessed that it was a
great relief to him to be able to take her about
in ways that suited his purse and yet have no fear
of being thought mean. Now he can buy her
everything her heart can desire; but he acknowledges
that he might not have been able to withstand
the temptation had she in her younger days
desired pleasures beyond his power honorably to
provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Helen after a pause, as two
girls passed the house with their arms about
each other&#8217;s waists. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it silly
for girls to be so &#8216;spooney&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly think it is in bad taste for them to
be so publicly demonstrative, and I could wish
that girls might be friends with each other more
as boys are. Now, there are Paul and Winfield.
Surely no girls ever thought more of each other
than these two boys, and yet I fancy we would
smile to see them embracing each other on all
occasions, as Lucy and Nellie do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so! I&#8217;ve heard Paul say, &#8216;Old
Chap,&#8217; or seen Winfield give Paul a slap on the
shoulder; but they are never silly and they&#8217;ve
been friends for years. But Lucy and Nellie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
have only been so &#8216;thick&#8217; for a few weeks, and
they&#8217;ll fall out pretty soon. Lucy is always having
such lover-like friends and then quarreling with
them. Now, she and Nellie are going to have a
mock wedding next week. They call themselves
husband and wife even now,&mdash;isn&#8217;t that silly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worse than silly,&mdash;I call it wrong,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Wayne. &#8220;Such morbid friendships are
dangerous, both to health and morals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the health, mother? I don&#8217;t see how that
can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I doubt if you can, but I hope that you
will believe me when I tell you they are dangerous.
When girls are so demonstrative, when
they claim to stand to each other as man and
woman, you may feel assured that the relation
is unnatural and that the drain upon the nervous
system is very great. I once knew a girl who
actually destroyed the health of a number of
girls in a school by such demonstrative friendships.
She always had one devoted friend who
could not live without her. I have known a
girl to cry day after day and actually go home
sick, because her friendship with this girl was
threatened. And it is said that another girl took
her own life from jealousy of this one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friendship is a grand thing when it is true and
worthy, but a morbid, unnatural sentimentality
does not deserve the name of friendship and I
should be very sorry to see you fall into the
toils of a morbid, unnatural relation with another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
girl. Yet I should be pleased to see you having
a sincere, womanly, noble affection for another
girl, one which would not waste itself in sentimentality
but be able to rise to heights of grand
renunciation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand you, mother, and I promise
you I will try to hold the highest ideals of
friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such talks as these brought mother and daughter
into such close companionship that Helen was
not afraid to bring her mother the deepest problems
of her young life.</p>
<p>It was Saturday afternoon, and mother and
daughter were sitting together sewing. The rain
was pouring, so that there was little fear of
visitors, and while Mrs. Wayne was discussing
with herself how she could begin to talk to her
daughter of her approaching womanhood, Helen
suddenly said, &#8220;Mother, what is the matter with
Clara Downs? She is going into consumption,
they say, and I heard Sadie Barker say to Cora
Lee that it was because Clara did not change
into a woman. What did she mean? I thought
we just grew into women. Isn&#8217;t that the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ask Sadie what she meant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no, the girls acted as if they didn&#8217;t want
me to hear, and then, I&#8217;d always rather you&#8217;d
tell me things, for then I feel sure that I know
them right.&#8221;</p>
<p>This little testimony of her trust in her mother
furnished Mrs. Wayne with the desired opportunity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
and she said, &#8220;In order that you may clearly
understand Sadie&#8217;s remark I shall have to make
a long explanation of how girls become women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother, don&#8217;t we just grow into women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, I shall have to say both yes
and no to that question. Girls do grow and
become women, but women are something more
than grown-up girls. This house is much bigger
than it was two years ago. Did it just grow
bigger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, not exactly. There are no more
rooms now than there were before, but some
rooms have been finished off and are used now,
when before they weren&#8217;t used at all, and so the
house seems bigger. But it can&#8217;t be that way with
our bodies, for we don&#8217;t have any new organs
added or finished off to make us women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what is done, my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! New organs added, mother? What
can you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, dear, that your bodily dwelling is
enlarged, not by the addition of new rooms, but
by the completing of rooms that have as yet
not been fitted up for use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not, but I hope to be able to make
you understand. You have studied your bodily
house and know of the rooms in the different
stories, the kitchen, laundry, dining-room, picture-gallery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and telegraph office,&mdash;in fact, all the rooms
or organs that keep you alive; but there is one
part of the house that you have not studied.
There are various rooms or organs which are not
needed to keep you alive, and which have, therefore,
been closed. As you approach womanhood,
these organs will wake up and become active,
and their activity is what will make you a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother, it sounds like a fairy story, a
tale of a wonderful magic palace, doesn&#8217;t it?
And Clara Downs hasn&#8217;t got these marvelous
rooms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are there, but they are evidently
not being finished off for use. I think, however,
the girls made the mistake of confounding cause
and effect. They say she is going into consumption
because she does not become a woman. I
think she does not become a woman because
she is going into consumption. Do you know
why we did not finish off these rooms in our house
sooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, father said he had not the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right. He did not say that he did
not have the money because he did not finish
off the rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, no, that would have been absurd; but I
don&#8217;t see how that applies to Clara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It needed money to finish off our house; so
it needs vitality to change from girl to woman,
and Clara seems not to have the vitality. She
is failing in health, hence she has not vital force
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
to spend in completing her physical development.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother, tell me more about this wonderful
change. Where are the new rooms and
what is their purpose? I can&#8217;t really believe
that I have some bodily organs that I never heard
of. What are they and where are they; when
will they be finished off? I am all curiosity.
Didn&#8217;t we study about them in our school physiology?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given me a good many questions
to answer, little girl, and I hardly know where
to begin answering them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In your school physiology you studied all
about the organs that keep you alive. What
did you learn about your bodily house? How
many stories is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three stories high, and then there is a cupola
on the top of all. I like to think of the head
as a cupola or observatory, resting on the tower
of the neck and turning from side to side as we
want to look around us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is the furniture in the different
stories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, the upper story is called the thorax, and
the one big room in it is the thoracic cavity.
It contains the heart and lungs. The next story
below is the abdominal cavity and it has a number
of articles of furniture, the liver, the stomach,
the spleen, the bowels, etc. Then the lower story
is&mdash;O, I&#8217;ve forgotten what it is called.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lower story is called the pelvis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, and the pelvic cavity contains the
reservoirs for waste material. I remember you
told me that once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right. The pelvic cavity contains the
bladder, which is the reservoir for waste fluid,
and the rectum, the outlet for waste solids. But
it contains more than these. It is here in the
pelvis that these organs of which you have not
heard are located. You remember when you
asked me about yourself and how you came into
the world I told you of a little room in mother&#8217;s
body where you lived and grew until you were
large enough to live your own independent existence.
Did you ever wonder where this room
is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I never thought much about it. I guess
I just thought it was in the abdominal cavity.
Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;No, the room is a little</span> sac that lies here
in the pelvis. I can best explain it to you by
a picture. Here it is. You see it looks like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
pear hanging with the small end down. It lies
just between the bladder and the rectum, and
a passage leads up to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I see. Doesn&#8217;t the bladder empty itself
through that passage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the outlet to the bladder is just at the
very entrance to this passage, but does not open
into the passage at all. This passage is called
the vagina, and the little room has two names.
One is Latin, uterus; the other is Saxon, womb&mdash;it
means the place where things are brought
to life. The Latin word is used by scientists,
but the Saxon word is used in the Bible and by
poets. Do you remember when Nicodemus came
to Jesus that he was told he must be born again,
and he said in surprise, &#8216;Can a man enter the
second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be
born?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I see now what he meant. I could not
understand it before. Of course, he knew that
was impossible, and so he could not see what
Jesus meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;David says, &#8216;Thou hast covered me in my
mother&#8217;s womb. I will praise thee, for I am <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title='Was fearfearfully'>fearfully</ins>
and wonderfully made.&#8217; Poets sometimes
speak of the womb of the morning, meaning
the place where morning lies and grows until it is
ready to burst forth in beauty on the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the Saxon word better than the Latin
one, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but as scientists use the Latin word we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
shall use that, so that we will know how to talk
on these subjects scientifically. The uterus
hangs suspended by two broad ligaments (marked
<i>ll</i> in the picture). There are also round ligaments
from the back and front which hold it loosely in
place. On the back of each broad ligament is
an oval body called the ovary (marked <i>o</i>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember once seeing in a hen that
Ellen was preparing for dinner a great number
of eggs of all sizes? That was the hen&#8217;s ovary.
<i>Ovum</i> means an egg, and <i>ovary</i> means the place
of the eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mother, women don&#8217;t have eggs, do they?
I don&#8217;t like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you do not like to use the word egg
we can say <i>ovum</i>, which, you know, is the Latin
word for egg. The plural is <i>ova</i>. Or we may
call the <i>ovum</i> the germ, which means the primary
source. The ovum or germ is a very tiny thing,
so small that it cannot be seen without a microscope;
240 laid side by side would make only
one inch in length.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mother, that is wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. The whole process of life is very
wonderful and very beautiful. The uterus and
ovaries belong to what is called the reproductive
system. As I said, until now your vital forces
have been employed in keeping you alive. Your
nutritive system, your muscular system, your nervous
system and so on, have all been busy taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
care of you only; but soon your reproductive
system will awaken and begin to take on activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what does that mean, mother?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:65px'>
<div class='figtag'>

Ova.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;It means that you are</span> entering on what is
known as the maternal period of your life; are
actually becoming a woman with all a woman&#8217;s
power of becoming a mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t mean that a girl of fourteen
could become a mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it might be possible; but no girl of fourteen
should be a mother, for she is not fully
developed and her children will not be strong as
if she had not married until after she were
twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me, mother, all about it. I don&#8217;t see
now how the baby grows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was showing you the ovary in which
are many ova. As the girl nears the age of
fourteen, these ova start to grow and once a
month one ripens and is thrown out of the ovary.
It is taken up by the Fallopian tube, marked <i>od</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
in the picture, and it passes down the tube into
the uterus and through the vagina out into the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can one tell when it passes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but there is a sign that this change has
taken place. The uterus is lined with a membrane
in which are many blood vessels, and
when the girl has reached this stage of development
and becomes a woman, the vessels
become very full of blood, so full that it oozes
out through the walls of the blood vessels into
the cavity of the uterus, and when it passes
out of the vagina the girl becomes aware of it
and knows that she has become a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;This process takes place once a month and
is called menstruation, from the Latin <i>mensum</i>,
a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it painful, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought not to be and is not, if the girl is
perfectly well. But sometimes girls have dressed
improperly and have displaced their internal
organs, or they have exhausted themselves with
pleasure-seeking, or in some other way have injured
themselves, in which case they may suffer
much pain. When girls get about this age mothers
are very anxious about them, very desirous that
they shall naturally and easily step over into the
land of womanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think that girls ought to be taught
about themselves, so that they would not do the
things which injure them.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think they should, and that is why I am
telling you all this to-day so that when the
change comes to you, you will not be frightened
and maybe do something from which you will
suffer all your life long, as many girls have
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of tight clothing becomes now
much more important than ever before. You
can see at once that the restriction of the clothing
comes just over the part of the body where
there is the least resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember about the seven upper
ribs, that are fastened to both spine and breast-bone;
and the five lower ribs, that are fastened
directly only to the spine and are attached in
front to the breast-bone by cartilage; and the
two floating ribs, lowest of all, and fastened only
to the spine. I have often wondered why the
important organs of the abdominal cavity should
not have been better protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was needful to leave the front of the body
covered only with muscular structure, or it could
not be bent and twisted about as we can now
bend it, and that would have hindered our activity.
Just imagine yourself going about encased
in bone from your shoulders to your hips.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen laughed merrily. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like it,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but that is just what is done by the
corset, and folks get used to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they become accustomed to the pressure
because the nerves lose their sensitiveness and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
no longer report their discomfort to the brain;
but the injury continues, nevertheless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, I wish you&#8217;d tell me just how tight
clothing is injurious. So many of the girls laugh
at me because I don&#8217;t wear a corset, and they
declare it does not hurt them. They all say they
wear their clothes perfectly loose and they think
they prove it by showing me how they can run
their fists up under their dress waists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, that can be done even with a very
tight dress, by just pressing a little more air
out of the lungs; but that is not a true measurement.
To learn if the dress is tight, one
should unfasten all of the clothing, draw in
the breath slowly until the lungs are filled to
their utmost capacity. Then, while the lungs
are held full, see if the clothing can be fastened
without allowing any air to escape. If it can,
then it is not tight; but if the lungs must be
compressed, ever so little, in order to allow the
clothing to be fastened, it is too tight. You see,
the power we have to breathe is the measure
of our power to do, and to lessen our breathing
capacity is to lessen our ability in all directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a statement yesterday that will interest
you. It was a recital of an experiment made by
Dr. Sargent on twelve girls in running 540 yards
in 2 minutes 30 seconds. The first time they
ran without corsets and their waists measured
25 inches. The pulse was counted before running
and found to beat 84 times a minute. Again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
it was counted after running and found to have
risen to 152. The second run was made in the
same length of time, but with corsets on, which
reduced the waist measure to 24 inches. Pulse
before running 84; after running 168, showing
the extra effort the heart was obliged to make
because of the restriction of the waist and consequent
lessening of the breathing power. He
also found that the corset reduced the breathing
capacity one-fifth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me read you another little item:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dr. Dickenson has been studying the pressure
of the corset. He says that in the ordinary
breathing we have to overcome in the resistance
and elasticity of chest and lungs a force of 170
pounds. If the woman whose waist measure is
27 inches wears a corset of the same size, so
that her waist is not compressed at all, there
is added a force of 40 pounds. If her natural
waist measure is 27 inches and is reduced by the
corset to
25½
inches, the pressure is 73 pounds.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Dr. Lucy Hall was physician at Vassar
College, she made some observations as to the
mental powers manifested by those who wore
and those who did not wear corsets. In a graduating
class in which there were thirty-five girls,
nineteen wore no corsets; eighteen members of
the class took honors, and of these thirteen wore
no corsets; seven of the class were appointed
to take part in public on Commencement Day,
and six of these wore no corsets. All who took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
prizes for essays wore no corsets; five girls were
class-day orators, and four of these wore no corsets;
five had not missed a day in four years,
and one had not missed a day in six years.
That speaks pretty loudly in favor of doing without
corsets, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; but some of the girls care more
for looks than for class honors. They say a girl
looks so queer without a corset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because we have set up false standards
of beauty. If we examine the finest statuary of
all ages, we shall not find a single figure that
has been accustomed to tight clothing. The artist
copies God&#8217;s ideal figure of the woman, not that
of the fashion plate. You see, we have become
so accustomed to the deformed figure that we
call it beautiful, just as the Chinese woman
thinks her deformed foot is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, isn&#8217;t it dreadful that the Chinese bind up
the feet of the little girls as they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is; but not as dreadful as that
Christian women bind up the vital parts of the
body and prevent their working as they should.
One can live without feet, but one could not live
without heart and lungs and other vital organs, and
can only half live when these organs are cramped
and crowded together so they cannot work properly.
If we were all truly artistic we would
be pained at the sight of the small waist, for we
should know that it was procured at the expense
of the vital organs. You have heard of the statue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
of the Venus de Medici, renowned as being the
most beautiful representation of a woman&#8217;s
figure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, yes, I have seen pictures of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A certain English actress was called a model
of loveliness in form and feature. Some one
has made a comparison between the two. Here
are the pictures and measurements:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</table>
<p style='clear: both'>&#8220;You see how graceful the curves of the Venus
(Fig. 2), how abrupt those of the actress (Fig. 1),
and yet to most people her figure looks the more
elegant. But I want to call your attention to
the fact that to create her figure is really to
lose much space, and to crowd together the important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
vital organs until their working power is
greatly hindered. This same actress has become
enlightened and now says: &#8216;Of course, no woman
can breathe properly in a tightly-laced corset. I
am horrified when I think of the way I used to
compress my waist, and look back at the pictures
showing my hour-glass figure with positive
amazement.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it strange that we never want
little rooms with furniture huddled close together,
except in our bodily dwellings? The Divine
Architect has given us grand apartments, with all
the machinery harmoniously related, and we think
we improve things by putting everything into
the closest possible quarters and disturbing the
harmony! But the damage is not done to the
heart and lungs alone. The liver is crowded
out of place until it sometimes reaches clear across
the abdomen and is creased with ruts from the
pressure of the ribs upon it. The stomach is
also pressed out of place. It belongs close up
under the diaphragm, but it is crowded by the
pressure down until it lies in the abdominal cavity,
as low down, sometimes, as the umbilicus,
six or eight inches below where it belongs.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;O, mother, that seems awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is awful, my dear, because the body is
created to do certain work, and to do that work
well, its laws should be regarded. We would not
think of interfering with the works of a watch
or a piano, because they are valuable, but we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
do not hesitate to interfere with the more valuable
organs of our bodies, and we do not even
think that we are offering an insult to the Creator.</p>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;But I have not told you</span> yet of the evil effects
in the displacement of the bowels. Do you remember
how many feet of intestines there are in
the body?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty feet of small and about four
feet of large intestines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how are they held in place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t just remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The small intestines are encased in a membrane
called the mesentery. It is just as if I
folded this strip of cloth in the middle lengthwise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and put my finger inside of the fold. The
small intestines lie in the middle fold of the
mesentery, and the edges of the mesentery are
gathered up like a ruffle and fastened to the
spine in a space of about six inches, leaving it
to flare out like a very full ruffle. In this way,
you see, the intestines are left free, and yet
cannot tie themselves in knots as they might if
but laid loosely in the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p style='clear: both'>&#8220;If the waist is constricted above them, they
sink down and pull on this attachment, and that
often causes backache and inability to stand or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
walk with comfort. It may also press the reproductive
organs out of place, and so cause
much pain and suffering at menstruation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am of the opinion that women were not
intended to be invalids in any degree because
of their womanhood; and very likely there would
be much less flow at menstrual periods if women
and girls lived in accordance with Nature&#8217;s laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother, you have not told me what this
blood is for. It seems as if it would not be necessary
for women to go through such an experience
every month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we do not fully know why it should
be so, but we do know when the little child is
growing in its little room, the mother does not
have the menstrual flow; so we may suppose that
it goes to nourish the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I see, and when not needed for the child,
it just passes away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and every time this occurs it says to the
woman that she is a perfect woman, capable of
all the duties of the wife and mother. This
thought should make her think very sacredly of
herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments there was silence between
mother and daughter, broken only by the sound
of the falling rain. At length Helen spoke.
&#8220;Mother, there is something I want to ask you
about. You remember last summer, when Mrs.
Vale and Mrs. Odell called on you, I was in the
library and they did not see me. While they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
were waiting for you they began to talk of
Edith Chenowyth and of something dreadful she
had been doing. They called her a very bad
girl. When you came in they spoke to you about
her and you said &#8216;Poor child, I am sorry for her;&#8217;
and they were quite angry that you should pity
her. Just before they left I made some slight
noise, and Mrs. Vale said, &#8216;I hope no one heard
what we&#8217;ve said,&#8217; and you said, &#8216;I hope not, I
am sure.&#8217; So I thought you would not want me
to know of it or I should have asked you about
what it all meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday I heard some of the girls talking
and one said, &#8216;Did you know that Edith Chenowyth
had a baby last night? She is down at old
Mrs. Fein&#8217;s. Her folks have turned her out of
the house.&#8217; Then Clara Downs said, &#8216;Well, they
ought to turn her out, acting as she has.&#8217; Then
they all said such dreadful things of her! And
while they were talking, Cora Lee came up and
said, &#8216;O, girls, I am an Auntie! My sister Ada
had the loveliest baby boy last night and my father
gave her $500 because it is his first grandson;
and the baby&#8217;s father opened a bank account in
the name of Charles Wyndham Bell. Ada is
just as happy as she can be and we are all so
proud.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother, Ada Lee and Edith Chenowyth
were in the same class at school; they sang a
duet together on the day of their graduation and
Edith was just as lovely as Ada. Now she has a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
baby and every one scorns her, while Ada has one
and she is honored and loved. I wish you&#8217;d
explain this to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my daughter, you see Ada is married
and Edith is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that; and yet that does not
explain to me why a child should be an honor
to one and a disgrace to the other. I know
people think so, but I want to know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to make you understand why, I shall
have to take you back to your lessons in botany.
You recall how you learned there of the reproduction
of plants. You learned that the pollen
must pass down the style and fertilize the seed
before it would grow; and you learned that the
stamen, anther and pollen were the male part
of the plant and the ovary, style and stigma the
female part of the plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I remember that I thought it rather
silly that in a school book the plants should be
spoken of as people, as if it were a fairy story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, my dear, it was only stating an actual
fact, and was not, as you fancied, a fairy story.
There are really fathers and mothers among
plants; if there were not there could be no new
plant life. In some plants the male and female
are united in the same flower; in other plants
there are male and female flowers, but all growing
on the same plant. In a third species all the
flowers of one plant will be male, and all of
another plant will be female. The fertilization
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
of plants is very interesting, for the insects and
the bees and the breezes often carry the pollen of
the male flowers to the female flowers, and so
the seeds are fertilized.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we come to study reproduction among
the human race, we find the same plan; in fact,
we find it in all forms of organized life, plants, animals
and man. That is, there must be fathers as
well as mothers.</p>

SPERMATOZOA.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;I told you of the germ</span> or ovum that is produced
by the ovary of the woman. That ovum
of itself could never become a new being. It
must be united with a life-giving principle furnished
by the man. This principle consists of a
fluid in which float tiny little creatures called
spermatozoa&mdash;one is a spermatozoon. Here is
a picture of some. They are too small to be seen
without the aid of a microscope. They are about
<a name='TC_3'></a><ins title='Was 1-500'><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub></ins>
of an inch long, that is, 500 of them laid
end to end, would cover only an inch in length.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If an ovum starts from the ovary and is not
hindered, it will pass on through the uterus and
the vagina into the world, and that is the end
of it; but if, when the ovum starts from the ovary
to make its way through the tube, the spermatozoa
are deposited here at the mouth of the
uterus, they will find their way up into the cavity,
and if one meets an ovum and enters into it, a
new life is begun. The ovum will now fasten
itself to the walls of the uterus and grow into
the little child.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can understand that, for the spermatozoa
to be placed where they can find their way into
the uterus, means a very close and familiar relation
of the man and woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;When two people have decided that they love
each other so well that they are willing to leave
all friends and ties of home, and in the presence
of witnesses promise to live together always, and
a clergymen has conducted a solemn ceremony
and pronounced them husband and wife, it is
perfectly proper for them to do what before would
not have been proper.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may go and live in a house by themselves,
occupy the same room, bear the same
name and be, in the eyes of the community, as
one person.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they desire to call into life a little child
of their own, it is fully in accordance with the
laws of God and man, and no one can criticise
them. They have violated no ideas of purity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
or propriety. But you can understand that if
an unmarried woman has a child, every one
knows that she has had, with some man, an intimate
relation to which they had no right, either
moral or legal. They have sacrificed modesty
and purity, and the child is a badge of disgrace,
rather than of honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it just as much of a disgrace to him
as to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I think it is, and so do many of
the best people; but, unfortunately, there are
many who do not think so, and blame the woman
or girl altogether. And the man, very likely, does
not blame himself. He says, &#8216;Well, she ought
not to have permitted it,&#8217; and so he gets out
of the way and leaves her to bear the shame
alone. It is a cowardly thing to do, for in all
probability he was the one who made the first
advances and, had she been wise, she would have
shunned the man who tried to lead her into wrong,
into doing that which would forfeit her self-respect
and the respect of the world. Even the
man scorns the woman whom he leads into disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose girls don&#8217;t understand it, do they?
Now, I did not understand, until just now as you
have told me about it, and I believe lots of the
girls are going into danger and don&#8217;t know it.
I must tell you something. Yesterday as I was
walking home from school with Belle Dane&mdash;you
know her, don&#8217;t you? Isn&#8217;t she pretty?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is pretty, and I should imagine pert
also. She has no mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as we were walking along, a young man
passed us. Belle smiled and bowed, and he bowed
too. I said, &#8216;Who is that?&#8217; She said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t
know, but isn&#8217;t he handsome? I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if he&#8217;d turn back and walk with us!&#8217; And
sure enough, in a moment he was walking at
her side, saying, &#8216;What a lovely day? Do you
walk here every day?&#8217; and she said, &#8216;Yes, as I
go from school. On Saturdays I walk by the
lake.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I am thinking of walking there
to-morrow. At what hour do you walk?&#8217; &#8216;About
4 o&#8217;clock,&#8217; she said. Then he looked at me.
&#8216;Does your friend walk there, too? I have a
friend who&#8217;d be glad to come.&#8217; Then I broke in&mdash;&#8216;No,
I never walk by the lake.&#8217; Then he bowed
and left, and Belle said, &#8216;O, you little goose!
Why did you say you didn&#8217;t walk by the lake?
He&#8217;d have brought his friend and we&#8217;d have had
such a good time. Ten to one he&#8217;ll bring flowers or
candy, and we could take a boat ride. You were
foolish.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to walk with
young men, especially if I don&#8217;t know them.&#8217;
And she laughed and said, &#8216;O, you&#8217;ll get over that
when you&#8217;re older and learn what fun it is. My,
he&#8217;s a gentleman! See how nice he dressed and
what pretty teeth he had and what nice words he
used.&#8217; Now, I thought maybe I was silly, but
after what you have told me to-day, I think she is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
going in dangerous places and maybe don&#8217;t know
it. I am so glad you told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, poor child! It was just so that Edith began.
She met a handsome young man. She
thought him a gentleman because he dressed fine.
She let him hold her hand, then put his arm
around her and kiss her, and so, little by little, he
led her on, and she thought it was all so nice,&mdash;and
now she is friendless and in great trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, it makes me think of a little girl I saw
at the seaside last summer. She was dancing on
the edge of the waves. They came up and washed
over her little pink toes and she laughed with
delight. After a time the tide rose a little higher
and the waves dashed over her feet and still she
thought it fun; and then came one big wave and
threw her down and carried her out to sea, and
if there hadn&#8217;t been some sailors right there with
a boat she would have been drowned,&mdash;and all the
time she thought it fun till the last wave came,
and then she was frightened awfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your illustration is a very good one, my daughter,
and I fear that poor Belle is dancing in the
gentle foam of a wave that will grow in power
till it carries her out to sea, a lost girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, I really don&#8217;t see how a girl can let a
man become so familiar with her. I should think
it would disgust her at once; and yet Edith seemed
like a perfect lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt you will understand this puzzling
matter better after a few years than you do now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
but I can explain it to you partly. It is a part of
human nature that men and women are very attractive
to each other, and in a way that does not
exist between men and men or women and women.
It may be called a sort of personal magnetism.
As they begin to develop into men and
women, they begin to feel this new attraction.
They want to please each other. New feelings
and emotions are felt. If their hands touch, they
feel a sort of electric thrill, even the glance of
the eye may cause the same thrill. They enjoy
it, and they do not know what it means. They do
not know that, while it is pleasant, it is also dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls are more ignorant than young men, because,
as a rule, they have been taught less. The
young men know more, but in all probability they
have not learned from sources that are pure. The
young girl does not understand that her coquettish
glances and tossings of the head and simperings
are so many intuitive efforts to awaken that
sort of magnetic thrill in the young man. If she
knew it, she would see that it is more maidenly to
hold in check all actions that would tend to make
the young man desire to be familiar with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother, if it is not right to be familiar,
why does God make us with those desires?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God has given us many desires that are right
under certain conditions and wrong under others
and He has given us reason with which to control
our desires. It is right to eat when the food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
is our own, but wrong to eat if we have stolen the
food. It is right to enjoy the attraction of one to
whom our heart and life is given, but otherwise
we are defrauding some one else. You can understand
that you would not want the man you are
to marry to have had familiarities with many other
girls, neither would he like to think that other
men had been permitted to be free with you.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were going to select a dress that was to
last all your life long, you would not choose goods
that had been handled and were shop-worn. Even
so with husband and wife. Each likes to feel
sure that the freshest, purest love of the heart and
modesty of person has been kept unstained from
the slightest unwarrantable familiarity.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;O Mother, I am so glad you are at home
again. I had a lovely talk with father
last evening, but it wasn&#8217;t you. He
gave me lots to think about, though.
He said that mothers need to have such a broad
education; that they should even be chemists,
mother, think of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that seem such a strange idea to you?
Really they need to be much more than that.
They should be good teachers, to instruct their
children, wise judges, in order to know what justice
is, doctors of medicine so as to understand
the first symptoms of illness and how to treat it,
and surgeons so as to know how to bind up
wounds, treat cuts and bruises and even how to
reduce a dislocated finger if necessary. They
should be physiologists so as to understand the
laws of bodily health, and psychologists so as to
know and obey the laws of the mental development
of their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mother! How can one girl learn all those
hard things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wayne smiled indulgently as she replied,
&#8220;O, she won&#8217;t have to learn all of them at once.
Taken one at a time, through all the years preceding
her marriage, she will find she can learn
something of each without taxing herself too severely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
For example, you can learn now how to
take care of your own health, and that will help
you to care for the health of your children when
they come. You have already studied First Aid
to the injured in your physiology class. When
you go to College you will study psychology as a
part of your course of study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that big word mean, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Psychology means the science of mind. I said
that mothers need to be psychologists; that is,
students of the science of mind, so that they will
understand the indications of the development of
mind in their babies. A child gets the largest
part of its education before it is six years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mamma, do you really mean that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do. In the first place, it has to
learn, one by one, and by repeated experiments,
its body. You do not realize now that you had to
learn, one by one, and by repeated experiments,
every one of the muscular movements that you
can now make without thinking of them. You remember
what hard work it was to learn the piano
and that was only learning to use a very few muscles
in a certain way. As a baby you had to practice
hours a day before you could learn to hold
anything in your fingers. Your little hands flew
about very wildly at first, but by constant practice
you gained skill at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mamma, I never thought that a baby was
practicing when it was throwing its hands about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is practicing, and it keeps it up hour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
after hour, day after day, until it has learned to
hold things, to pull itself up, to sit up, to hold its
head up, to creep, to walk, to climb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any idea what a wonderful feat has
been accomplished when a baby has learned to
walk? Physiologists tell us that walking is continually
beginning to fall and perpetual recovery
from falling. It is a greater thing for the baby
than those acrobatic feats which so amazed you
the other day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the mental education begins also at birth.
The baby is building his brain by everything he
sees and does, and it is the mother&#8217;s duty to see
that this brain-building goes on in accordance
with the law of his nature. Every baby is a new
being with a nature of his own, and what was
good for his brother may not be good for him.
The training that will give one child self-confidence
will make a little tyrant of another; what
would render one merely amenable to control
might make a coward of another. So you see,
my dear, that a mother needs to have great knowledge
of the laws of mind and great insight in the
applying of those laws to the particular cases she
has in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really seems, mamma, as if girls ought to
study all those things before they marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed they ought, but I fear they never will
until they come to have a clearer idea of the value
and importance of the mother&#8217;s work. When they
realize that the great and lasting work of the world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
is done in the homes, by the mothers, with their
little children, then we shall have men demanding
that girls shall be prepared for that important
work by previous education.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is another way, too, in which women are
given great power over the destiny of the world,
and that is through heredity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that word mean, mother? I have
heard it very often, but people speak as if it were
something undesirable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heredity means the passing on of traits or talents
from parents to children. Now, your eyes
are like papa&#8217;s. They are a part of your heredity
from him. You have other features like him,
and you have many of his traits. It has been easy
to teach you to be orderly because you have inherited
his love of order. Then, too, you have
many of my characteristics. My hair, my love of
music, my quick temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen looked at her mother somewhat in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean, mamma, that I have a quick
temper because you had one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do; and if I had known, when I
was of your age, what I know now, I might have
given you a different disposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will my children have a temper because I
have one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a greater probability of their
having quick tempers because you have one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I help it, if I got my temper from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
you and just passed it on to them? Certainly I
am not to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people excuse themselves for their faults
in just that way; but that is to give evil greater
power than good, and we don&#8217;t believe in that, you
know. Each one has the power to make himself
over, and in the process he may change the direction
of the inheritance of his children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that if I overcome my temper, my
children will not be so likely to have tempers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, by controlling yourself you will have given
them greater power of self-control; that is
worth working for, isn&#8217;t it? If, when I was of
your age, I had begun to govern my temper, I
should have been helping you. So it is in every
field of effort. If you are a good student and
cultivate your mental powers to the best of your
ability, you will make it easier for your children
to be good students. Now, in your young girlhood,
you are working to help future generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe I&#8217;ll never have any children, mamma;
what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us can see our future, but if we are
wise we will prepare for the probabilities. At
your age I could not be sure that I would ever be
a mother, and now I have several children to call
forth every power that I possess through inheritance
or by education. You are not sorry that in
many ways I was wise enough so to cultivate myself
that you have inherited desirable qualities;
and you have cause to regret that I did not know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
now to do better for you. You can learn through
my failures, and be kinder to your children than
I have been to you. I can assure you of one
thing,&mdash;even if you never have children, you will
never regret having cultivated yourself in every
talent and virtue, but you may have great cause
for sorrow if you fail to develop the best in yourself.
There is no grief in the world like that
caused by wilful or wicked sons and daughters.
Their waywardness brings not only sorrow but
self-condemnation on the parents who must feel
that in some way they have been to blame, either
in the inheritance they passed on or the training
they gave. And there is no happiness equal to
the just pride felt in honorable children. As Solomon
says: &#8216;Children&#8217;s children are the crown of
old men, and the glory of children are their fathers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was silent a moment and then asked,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the law of heredity a very cruel
law? It doesn&#8217;t seem fair that children should be
punished for the sins of their parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s laws are never cruel, dear. They are
always made for our good, and they will be for
our good, if we use them rightly. Harry Severn
fell yesterday from a scaffold and broke his leg
because of the law of gravitation. You might say
that was a cruel law, and that God was unkind to
make such a law whereby we can be so seriously
injured. But think for one moment what that
law means in the universe. If it were not for this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
mysterious force which we call gravitation, the
whole creation would be in chaos. Nothing would
stay in place, buildings could not be made, people
would fly off the earth and go, no one knows whither.
Why, all the suns, moons, and stars of the
universe are held in place by gravitation. If we
are ever hurt through the action of that law it is
because we were not happily related to it, that is
all. The law is good, and what we have to do
is to learn to work with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just so with this law of heredity. It is
the law of transmission. It works right along and
transmits good or evil. It is our part to relate
ourselves to it so that it will transmit mostly good.
When we come to think of it, we see that that is
what it principally does. Health, and honesty,
and virtue, all good traits, are so constantly transmitted
that we do not think of their coming
through heredity, just as we do not think of all
order and stability coming through gravity; but
when undesirable traits are inherited we complain
of the law, just as we complain when we are hurt
through the law of gravitation. But do you not
see that it is the very fact that the law is sure,
that it invariably transmits evil, is one guarantee
of its surety in transmitting good? Indeed, the
Bible tells us that good is transmitted in greater
degree than evil. The third commandment gives
us the law of heredity: &#8216;For I, the Lord thy God,
am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the
fathers upon the children to the third and fourth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
generation of them that hate me and showing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and
keep my commandments.&#8217; That does not mean
thousands of individuals, but, as the revised version
gives it, &#8216;thousands of generations.&#8217; So you
see what encouragement this law gives us. The
evil in us is to be transient, the good everlasting.
Instead of being weighed down by our undesirable
inheritances, we should be encouraged to overcome
them and to cultivate our good ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, don&#8217;t you think the fathers have something
to do as well as the mothers, in trying to
give a better inheritance to the children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely do, and that is where I think a girl
needs to be especially wise in the choice of a
husband. If a man has traits or habits that she
would not want her children to have, she should
remember that, through the law of heredity, that
trait is one they will be very likely to inherit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls quite often think it does not matter if a
young man smokes, or even if he drinks a little,
but when we study heredity we see what a threat
such habits are to the health and welfare of his
children. I remember when John Orland was a
handsome young man, he drank, sometimes to excess.
Kittie Claiborne knew this, and her friends
opposed her marrying him, but she thought she
could reform him, and you know the result. Her
husband is a confirmed drunkard, as is her youngest
son. The oldest drinks, too, though not to
such excess, and you know that Kitty Orland, such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
a beautiful girl, has more than once been found
under the influence of liquor. The second girl
died of consumption, and the second son is weak-minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma, do you mean that this is all because
Mr. Orland drinks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The observation of scientific men as to the effects
of alcohol through inheritance would lead us
to think so. I find this little item in the paper.
You may read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen read&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;European scientists have recently given much
attention to the physical degradation among children
which they believe to be the result of intemperance
on the part of the parents. A startling
example was recently published in the <i>London
Daily News</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some months ago a workman and his wife,
accompanied by a small boy of four, waited on
Doctor Garnier, the physician who presides over
the insanity ward at the Paris Depot, or Central
Police Station. The parents were in great distress,
and the story they had to tell was that on
two occasions the lad, their son, who was with
them, had attempted to murder his baby brother.
On the last occasion the mother had just arrived
in time to prevent him from cutting the baby&#8217;s
throat with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Examined by Doctor Garnier, the child declared
it was quite true that he wished to murder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
his brother, and that it was his firm intention to
accomplish his purpose, sooner or later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking the parents into an adjoining room,
Doctor Garnier said to the father, &#8216;Are you a
drinker?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man protested indignantly. He had never
been drunk in his life. His wife backed up
his assertion. Her husband, she said, was the
most sober of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hold out your hand at arm&#8217;s length,&#8217; said
the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man obeyed. After a few seconds the
hand began that devil&#8217;s dance to which alcohol
fiddles the tune.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;As I thought,&#8217; said the doctor. &#8216;My poor
fellow, you are an <i>alcoholique</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He questioned the man, who, with tears in
his eyes, related that, being a brewer&#8217;s drayman,
it was his duty to deliver casks of beer to his master&#8217;s
customers, carrying the casks up to various
stages. A glass of wine was occasionally offered
him as a <i>pouboire</i>. The total quantity so absorbed
by him amounted to a liter, or a liter and
a half per day. This had been going on steadily
for several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;With the result,&#8217; said the doctor, &#8216;that you,
who have never been drunk, have become so completely
alcoholized that you have transmitted to
that unfortunate baby in the next room a form of
epilepsy which has developed into homicidal
mania.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it awful, mamma? I should not want
to marry a man who drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope you never will. But there
are other habits that are evil in their effects.
Smoking, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mamma, smoking isn&#8217;t inherited, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know but we might say that it
is. I knew a woman who was an inveterate smoker.
When her baby was born, it cried night and
day until one day the mother, nearly distracted,
took the pipe from her mouth and put it between
the baby&#8217;s lips and it stopped crying at once, and
after that she took that method to still its cries.
You see, it had been under the influence of tobacco
all the time before it was born, and when it
no longer felt that influence it was uncomfortable
until it had the tobacco again. You know how
hard it is for a man to give up smoking. All poisons
by long use make such an impression on the
body that it suffers when the poisons are taken
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tobacco paralyzes the nerves of sensation, so
that feeling is lessened. That is why men like to
use it. They think they feel better, when in reality
they feel less, or not at all; and to have no
feeling or power to feel is a dangerous condition.
Pain, or sensation, is our great protection, and to
remove sensation by paralysis is to render ourselves
open to danger. This paralytic condition
may become an inheritance. Many children have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
infantile paralysis because their fathers are users
of tobacco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad my father doesn&#8217;t use it,&#8221; exclaimed
Helen with emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you may well be glad, and you can
see to it that your children have the same cause
for rejoicing. The girls of to-day have a wonderful
influence on all time, the present and the
future. I wish they knew how to use it wisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But girls think it is manly to smoke. I&#8217;ve
heard lots of them say so. Stella Wilson says she
wouldn&#8217;t marry a man that didn&#8217;t smoke; and
Kate Barrows said the other day that she thought
girls had no right to interfere with the enjoyment
of men by asking them to give up smoking.
She said she knew how nice it was, for she had
tried it; and she said the most fashionable women
smoke, and she means to smoke when she has a
home of her own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which only proves that she is a poor,
ignorant girl who does not know her own value to
herself, or to the world. She may yet have cause
to weep over children made weak and nervous, or
who have died because of her ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it sad that ignorance does not save us
from punishment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it does not. If you can&#8217;t swim, you
may drown, even while trying to save another.
God&#8217;s laws cannot vary to save us from the penalty
of ignorance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wonder now, dear, if you are not beginning
to see the greatness of woman&#8217;s work. In her
own vigor she creates health for the future of the
nation. So you see whether you wear your overshoes
or not, may be a question of importance to
the race. By her virtue, courage, patience, purity,
she is storing up those qualities for the men
and women of the future. By her demanding of
her future husband that he shall be without fear
and without reproach, as clean in life and thought
as herself, she is building up protections around
the children of generations to come. Even the
young girls of to-day are creating national conditions
for the future, are deciding the destiny of
the nation,&mdash;yes, of the race. The great structures
that men build will in time perish, but character
is eternal. Is it not even a greater thing
to be a woman than to be a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to think so, and I think after this I&#8217;ll
try to feel that even I am of importance to the
world, instead of regretting that I am not a man.&#8221;</p>
